ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Aniket Sandhan â€” a Software Engineer at Wootz.Work and a final-year undergraduate at IIT Kanpur (B.S. Chemistry).  

I enjoy building **end-to-end AI systems** â€” from **vision pipelines** (YOLOv8, Restormer, U-Net) and **speech models** (Wav2Vec, WavLM, Whisper) to **GenAI multi-agent systems** and **retrieval-augmented QA tools**. My work spans research, startups, and industry, blending **machine learning, data science, and full-stack engineering**.

ðŸ”¨ **Key Interests**
- AI/ML: Computer Vision, Speech, Generative AI, Causal Inference  
- Data Engineering: Pipelines, RAG, Vector Databases, Cloud APIs  
- Full-Stack Development: Flask, Node.js, React, REST APIs  

ðŸ“‚ **Highlighted Projects**
- [Trend2Opportunity Intelligence System](https://github.com/Aniketiitk21/Trend2Opportunity-Intelligence-System) â€“ Multi-agent GenAI for market insights  
- [Chat With Your Data](https://github.com/Aniketiitk21/Chat-With-Your-Data) â€“ RAG-based QA on PDFs  
- [DeepFake Detection](https://github.com/Aniketiitk21/Deep-Fake-Detection) â€“ Real-time fake image detection using DenseNet/ViT  
- [MBA753M](https://github.com/Aniketiitk21/MBA753M) â€“ Causal inference methods in business analytics  

ðŸ“ˆ Previously, I worked at Codemo (AI/ML Consultant), MooRakshak (Computer Vision Intern), SIIC IITK (Business Intern), and Dilaton Defense (AI Intern).  

ðŸ’¡ I use GitHub to share my research prototypes, AI experiments, and projects that combine **academic rigor with real-world applications**.
